## Don’t Hire Just Any Sign Company Until You Read This  
### A Business Owner’s Guide to Choosing the Right Signage Partner in Johannesburg

**Need custom signage for your business?**  
Before choosing a signage supplier in Johannesburg, it’s critical to know what separates a generic print shop from a true signage specialist. Many businesses make the mistake of going with the cheapest quote—only to end up with poor-quality signs that fade, peel, or don’t comply with safety standards.

Take **Lerato**, for example. As a retail manager launching a new store in Sandton, she hired a company offering “budget-friendly” outdoor signs. The sign warped in the heat within months, the LED lights flickered constantly, and there was zero after-sales support. Eventually, she turned to **Millennium Signs** to redesign and replace the signage—delaying her launch and doubling her signage spend.

**This doesn’t have to be your story.**  
Whether you're opening a new store, revamping your office space, or rolling out signage across multiple locations, choosing the right signage partner from day one saves you time, money, and unnecessary stress.
